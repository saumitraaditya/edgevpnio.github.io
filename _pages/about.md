# <i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> Brief history and context

EdgeVPN.io is an evolution of the IP-over-P2P (IPOP) project. IPOP started as an IP-based peer-to-peer overlay targeting personal devices, [and over time the architecture evolved](https://search.ieice.org/bin/pdf_link.php?category=B&lang=E&year=2020&fname=e103-b_1_2&abst=) to adopt various standards, support centralized user/group management, and incorporate software-defined networking, culminating in the current architecture, tailored for research and development in nascent edge computing applications. 

EdgeVPN is a research and development project that builds on an [extensive track record of research in overlay virtual networks](/research). The core design team in based in the [ACIS Lab](https://www.acis.ufl.edu) in the [ECE department](https://www.ece.ufl.edu) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu). The software is funded in part by a grant from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov) (OAC-2004441, OAC-2004323). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
